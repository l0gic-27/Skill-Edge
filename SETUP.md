## ⚠️ STEP 1: Add Your Groq API Key

**IMPORTANT:** Before running the app, you must add your Groq API key!

1. Open this file: `src/utils/groqAPI.js`

   ```javascript
   const GROQ_API_KEY = 'YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE';
   ```

3. Replace `'YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual API key:
   ```javascript
   const GROQ_API_KEY = 'gsk_your_actual_key_here';
   ```

4. Save the file
